# Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with LSTM and Multiple Features (Predicting Google Stock Prices)

## Description
This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting Google stock prices, a methodology that can be applied to various other scenarios. The prediction considers multiple predictive factors (features) such as historical low prices, high prices, trading volume, and adjusted prices to forecast the final stock price.

## Features
- LSTM-based neural network for accurate time series forecasting.
- Incorporation of multiple features such as historical lows/highs, volume, and adjusted prices for comprehensive analysis.
- Applicability to various stock market scenarios beyond Google stock prices.
